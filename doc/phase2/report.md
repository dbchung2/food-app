# Phase 2 Report

## Initial Planning

1. Our definition of "Scrum Master" was someone who evaluates how the team works when moving forward on the project. This involves actions like making sure everyone attends meetings, making sure meetings are known of in advance, and taking notes during meetings for reference later, among others. In what time we had in the sprint, we attempted to rotate the role so as to have everyone get used to how the role runs.
2. We decided to estimate overall task size based on both the effort needed to complete a particular task as well as how broad the task would be in the scope of our project. For example, in our project doing something like creating a view in an android application would be a small task as it requires minimal effort and is only a small piece of the overall project. However, something like setting up a database is a relatively large task, requires quite a bit of effort to accomplish, and is a central element to the project. 

## Sprint Backlog
1. For our second sprint, we wanted to build a minimal version of our app that had only the absolutely essential features implemented. As a team, we decided that reviewing the dish was the quintessential feature we wanted to implement, using a constructed database and barebones android skeleton.
2. During our initial planning, we outlined all the separate components we needed to build for an initial app to work, and created issues for each of them to provide further guidance. We then volunteered to take on issues based on where our prior experience was - some had database experience, some had previous experience programming for Android, etc.
