## The Project Objective

Our project's objective is to build an app that enhances the users experience when eating at restaurants. With our app, users will be able to rate the dishes of a restaurant they eat at, let them keep wish lists (of what they want to order during future trips at a restaurant) as well as keep track of what they've ordered at each restaurant they go to.

Our minimum requirements list is as follows.

A user may:
 * Add specific menu items from a restaurant they go to. these items include the following parameters:
    * A picture of the dish (optional)
    * The user rating of the dish (mandatory)
    * The amount they paid for the dish (mandatory)
    * The type of cuisine of the dish (optional)
    * A short description of the dish (optional)
    * The date they had the dish (will be automatically taken from system data)
 * View their order history by restaurants they've visited
 * Create and view their own wish list by restaurant, for future reference

This information will be kept track of in the user's profile. Other pieces of data in a user profile include what they have spent on each menu item as well as keeping track of how much they have spent at each restaurant. 

# Key Users and Scenarios

1. Jack is a 20 year old man living in the city, who has access to disposable income. While not necessarily a food fanatic, he enjoys the occasional night out with friends or a significant other. Jack may want to know whether one type of pasta is better than the other while eating at his local Italian restaurant. Jack can then compare the two dishes by looking them up, and then keep track of what he has ordered in the past whenever he visits again. 
2. Jenna is a 22 year old woman living in the heart of downtown. A self-described "foodie," she is always itching to try out new menu items at her favourite restaurants (of which there are many) as well as getting the first crack at that new mexican-thai-pub fusion restaurant that just opened up down the block. With our app, her extensive wish list and meticulously-detailed reviews of her orders assist her in always making the right choice when ordering her food. 

# Key Principles

1. Our first key principle is that we value crowd-created content. As our app is adopted, the database of dishes and therefore reviews grows. This ultimately would be cyclical in notion - a growing database introduces more people to the app (through word-of-mouth, curiosity, or otherwise) who then add their own contributions to the database, and repeat. 
2. Second, we want our app to be easy to use. A simple UI is extremely important in order to build growth. Users will instantly be turned off by a cluttered, complex interface. By keeping the UI clean and easy to navigate, users will be pleased with how easy it is to perform all of the functions in it, regardless of how technically-savvy they are. This will guarantee a growing userbase of all types of users.
