## The Project Objective

Our project's objective is to build an app that enhances the users experience when eating at restaurants. 

Our minimum requirements list is as follows.

A user may:
 * Add specific menu items from a restaurant they go to. these items include the following parameters:
    * A picture of the dish (optional)
    * The user rating of the dish (mandatory)
    * The amount they paid for the dish (mandatory)
    * The type of cuisine of the dish (optional)
    * A short description of the dish (optional)
    * The date they had the dish (will be automatically taken from system data)
 * View their order history by restaurants they've visited
 * Create and view their own wish list by restaurant, for future reference

* Information will be kept track of in the user's profile
* Other pieces of data in a user profile include:
   * What they have spent on each menu item
   * Keeping track of how much they have spent at each restaurant

# Key Users

1. Jack, 20 years old, with disposable income. Casual eater, will occasionally go eat out somewhere new.
2. Jenna, 22 years old. Self-described food fanatic. Always wants to try the next new thing on the menu.
3. Tom, 30 years old. Busy professional worker. Likes to plan his restaurant visits ahead of time. 

# Scenarios

1. Jack recently checked his calendar to see that his 6-month anniversary with his girlfriend is coming up. As an occasional user of our app, he has some reviews and looks and what other people are eating from time to time. He wants to browse around and see if there are any ratings of dishes at some of his past favourite restaurants that he knows his girlfriend will enjoy. 
2. Jenna always gets notifications delivered straight to her e-mail about the food industry in the city. While getting ready to go out to a restaurant she's visited before, she checks to see what's on the menu that she hasn't tried, and bases her choices off of that. She then gets a ping about the new mexican-thai fusion restaurant soon to be opening. She itches to try it and adds it to her wishlist so she can remember it for the future. 
3. Tom gets invited out to eat with some of his work colleagues. He reluctantly accepts, knowing it'll take away from his work schedule. As he doesn't eat out often, he looks at some of the top rated dishes and wants to see which one will be a good choice for him. Being able to plan in advance saves a lot of trouble and time in Tom's busy schedule.

# Key Principles

1. Value crowd-created content - Starting out small, the app thrives on all the different user experiences in order to build and sustain growth. 
2. Ease of use - We want customers to enjoy using the app, to make them continue to want to use it. A user experience that can be appreciated by the whole user spectrum promotes a good customer-developer interaction.
