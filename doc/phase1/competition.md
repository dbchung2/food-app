How is our product different from Zomato?
	• Discovered your desired restaurant? Excited about your dining experience? Now, our question is “what should you eat if it’s your first time in the restaurant?” Not only we offer what Zomato offers, we help users with deciding menu as well in order to serve them with the best dining experience.

If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios,
Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
	User 1. Lisa. She often goes out for dinner and like to try different popular local restaurants. Since she is not familiar with the new restaurant menu, she often asks the waitress for some recommendation/popular menu. Our product can help Lisa better with deciding menus.

Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?
	- Zomato might wanted to focus more on providing users with places to go but once a place is selected, they want the user to try out diversified menus not focused on what might be recommended; the experience of restaurant is open end experience. But with our product, we want the user to try and experience best out of best.
