## The Creative Process

Our first team meeting took place at BA 3270 on OCT.9 by gathering all teammates through piazza and text massage. After the first meeting, we decided to use two new tools to assist us with the overall project. First, we started a group on Slack to discuss and exchange ideas on the days we weren't able to meet up in person. Since we also needed to meet in person to flesh out our ideas, we made extensive use of Doodle in order to find times that worked best for all of us.

The main decisions for our project were mostly made during our physical meetings that we held about 1 to 2 times a week for 20-30 minutes each. At the beginning of each meeting, we first listed out the decisions that needed to be made, then we brainstormed and took turns to express our individual thoughts and solutions before voting on the final decisions. Besides the physical meeting(s) we had every week, we also as before talked extensively on Slack to discuss any urgent issues that popped up.

Our user stories were created and selected based on two main criteria:
1. How important would it be for this user to have access to one of our main functions
2. When using our app, how much would they use it above other functions they could use
We aimed to divide our user stories and scenarios by our personas since they primarily use our app for different things at varying importances, as this would better outline the features our app would contain and highlight why it fits the role that it does. 

So far our meetings have been efficient and project deliverables have been divided efficiently and completed on time. However, scheduling meetings is still an issue due to how busy and varies each of our schedules are. Moving forward, however, we aim to make this more of a priority as a team that communicates together efficiently will produce better results.
