## Process
## Organization
For the third phase, we decided to organize ourselves in a scrum fashion. We continued to rotate the role of 'Scrum Master' throughout the group, which created an easier method for organizing group meetings and keeping track of app development information. This was done by setting up times for group meetings, online and in person, and making note of important application designs, such as how a certain feature works or how a part of the backend interacts with the frontend.

We compared the features that we finished in the second phase to the final product described in the MVP and drafted a list of what still need to be implemented. From there, we decided on the task size of each feature in the list, prioritized the features and assigned ourselves to the tasks we were comfortable with. We used Git issues to document the task size and priorities, Google Docs to draft the feature implementation list, Slack to oranize our meetings and scrum artifacts - ie. burndown charts, meeting logs, etc. - to further organize ourselves.
