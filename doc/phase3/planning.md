# Planning

## Initial Planning 
- Our group's plan for phase 3 of the project was to build an almost-complete and semi-polished MVP to demo to the TA. While in phase 2 our focus was to get separate parts of our project working standalone i.e. different, functioning views, this phase was more focused on connecting our features so that they interact with each other, and extending the functionality of our features that had already been implemented. Furthermore, we wanted to implement a basic UI which followed slightly the mockup design we submitted in phase 1. 
    - For example, extending existing features would be outlined by something like implementing a separate registration page for new users. In phase 2, all we had was a single page for login and registration. Our new registration page actively integrated with the original login screen and included database searching and forcing users to make medium-strong passwords.
- We went through our plan and made sure we were able to complete what we wanted in a realistic timeframe. As we had felt like our product for Phase 2 was already quite a ways along, it was easy to see where we needed to extend, implement, or design. 
- In the beginning stages of the phase, we created a google doc outlining what exactly we wanted to implement in terms of specific features. Everyone assigned features to themselves, created issues on the repo, and used those to update accordingly. This way, we would be more organized in our implementation and hopefully run into less bugs along the way. 

## Re-Planning and Adjustments
- Unfortunately, actually completing a backlog comes with challenges and eventual realizations that something just can't be done in time. In the planning in preparation for phase 3, we had wanted to tie in implementation of the camera API (to link pictures with our items) and the location API (local searching of places near you) as they're both integral parts of other apps that we described as our competitors. 
- However, we realized through working through our implementation that those features were very advanced - maybe a bit too advanced to show in a demo that was supposed to be our MVP. We felt that it would be a better idea to fit this implementation in our final presentation, and to focus first and foremost on making a solid MVP to show the TA without having such a large task bog us down.
